  abstract={Plants exhibit a vast array of sesquiterpenes, C15 hydrocarbons which often function as herbivore-repellents or pollinator-attractants. These in turn are produced by a diverse range of sesquiterpene synthases. A comprehensive analysis of these enzymes in terms of product specificity has been hampered by the lack of a centralized resource of sufficient functionally annotated sequence data. To address this, we have gathered 262 plant sesquiterpene synthase sequences with experimentally characterized products. The annotated enzyme sequences allowed for an analysis of terpene synthase motifs, leading to the extension of one motif and recognition of a variant of another. In addition, putative terpene synthase sequences were obtained from various resources and compared with the annotated sesquiterpene synthases. This analysis indicated regions of terpene synthase sequence space which so far are unexplored experimentally. Finally, we present a case describing mutational studies on residues altering product specificity, for which we analyzed conservation in our database. This demonstrates an application of our database in choosing likely-functional residues for mutagenesis studies aimed at understanding or changing sesquiterpene synthase product specificity.}

  abstract={The vast number of protein structures currently available opens exciting opportunities for machine learning on proteins, aimed at predicting and understanding functional properties. In particular, in combination with homology modelling, it is now possible to not only use sequence features as input for machine learning, but also structure features. However, in order to do so, robust multiple structure alignments are imperative. Here we present Caretta, a multiple structure alignment suite meant for homologous but sequentially divergent protein families which consistently returns accurate alignments with a higher coverage than current state-of-the-art tools. Caretta is available as a GUI and command-line application and additionally outputs an aligned structure feature matrix for a given set of input structures, which can readily be used in downstream steps for supervised or unsupervised machine learning. We show Caretta’s performance on two benchmark datasets, and present an example application of Caretta in predicting the conformational state of cyclin-dependent kinases.}

  abstract={Sesquiterpene synthases (STSs) catalyze the formation of a large class of plant volatiles called sesquiterpenes. While thousands of putative STS sequences from diverse plant species are available, only a small number of them have been functionally characterized. Sequence identity-based screening for desired enzymes, often used in biotechnological applications, is difficult to apply here as STS sequence similarity is strongly affected by species. This calls for more sophisticated computational methods for functionality prediction. We investigate the specificity of precursor cation formation in these elusive enzymes. By inspecting multi-product STSs, we demonstrate that STSs have a strong selectivity towards one precursor cation. We use a machine learning approach combining sequence and structure information to accurately predict precursor cation specificity for STSs across all plant species. We combine this with a co-evolutionary analysis on the wealth of uncharacterized putative STS sequences, to pinpoint residues and distant functional contacts influencing cation formation and reaction pathway selection. These structural factors can be used to predict and engineer enzymes with specific functions, as we demonstrate by predicting and characterizing two novel STSs from Citrus bergamia.}

  abstract={As the number of experimentally solved protein structures rises, it becomes increasingly appealing to use structural information for predictive tasks involving proteins. Due to the large variation in protein sizes, folds and topologies, an attractive approach is to embed protein structures into fixed-length vectors, which can be used in machine learning algorithms aimed at predicting and understanding functional and physical properties. Many existing embedding approaches are alignment based, which is both time-consuming and ineffective for distantly related proteins. On the other hand, library- or model-based approaches depend on a small library of fragments or require the use of a trained model, both of which may not generalize well. We present Geometricus, a novel and universally applicable approach to embedding proteins in a fixed-dimensional space. The approach is fast, accurate, and interpretable. Geometricus uses a set of 3D moment invariants to discretize fragments of protein structures into shape-mers, which are then counted to describe the full structure as a vector of counts. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in various tasks, ranging from fast structure similarity search, unsupervised clustering and structure classification across proteins from different superfamilies as well as within the same family.}

  abstract={Plant terpene synthases (TPSs) can mediate formation of a large variety of terpenes, and their diversification contributes to the specific chemical profiles of different plant species and chemotypes. Plant genomes often encode a number of related terpene synthases, which can produce very different terpenes. The relationship between TPS sequence and resulting terpene product is not completely understood. In this work we describe two TPSs from the Camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. One of these, CiCaMS, acts as a monoterpene synthase (monoTPS), and mediates the production of myrcene, while the other, CiCaSSy, acts as a sesquiterpene synthase (sesquiTPS), and catalyses the production of α-santalene, β-santalene and trans-α-bergamotene. Interestingly, these enzymes share 97% DNA sequence identity and differ only in 22 amino acid residues out of 553. To understand which residues are essential for the catalysis of monoterpenes resp. sesquiterpenes, a number of hybrid synthases were prepared, and supplemented by a set of single-residue variants. These were tested for their ability to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes by in vivo production of sesquiterpenes in E. coli, and by in vitro enzyme assays. This analysis pinpointed three residues in the sequence which could mediate the change in product specificity from a monoterpene synthase to a sesquiterpene synthase. Another set of three residues defined the sesquiterpene product profile, including the ratios between sesquiterpene products.}

  abstract={The growing prevalence and popularity of protein structure data, both experimental and computationally modelled, necessitates fast tools and algorithms to enable exploratory and interpretable structure-based machine learning. Alignment-free approaches have been developed for divergent proteins, but proteins sharing func-tional and structural similarity are often better understood via structural alignment, which has typically been too computationally expensive for larger datasets. Here, we introduce the concept of rotation-invariant shape-mers to multiple structure alignment, creating a structure aligner that scales well with the number of proteins and allows for aligning over a thousand structures in 20 minutes. We demonstrate how alignment-free shape-mer counts and aligned structural features, when used in machine learning tasks, can adapt to different levels of functional hierarchy in protein kinases, pinpointing residues and structural fragments that play a role in catalytic activity.}

  abstract = {Most proteins fold into 3D structures that determine how they function and orchestrate the biological processes of the cell. Recent developments in computational methods have led to protein structure predictions that have reached the accuracy of experimentally determined models. While this has been independently verified, the implementation of these methods across structural biology applications remains to be tested. Here, we evaluate the use of AlphaFold 2 (AF2) predictions in the study of characteristic structural elements; the impact of missense variants; function and ligand binding site predictions; modelling of interactions; and modelling of experimental structural data. For 11 proteomes, an average of 25\% additional residues can be confidently modelled when compared to homology modelling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the PDB. AF2-based predictions of protein disorder and protein complexes surpass state-of-the-art tools and AF2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared to experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered. In summary, we find that these advances are likely to have a transformative impact in structural biology and broader life science research.},
