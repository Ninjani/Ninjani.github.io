  abstract={Plants exhibit a vast array of sesquiterpenes, C15 hydrocarbons which often function as herbivore-repellents or pollinator-attractants. These in turn are produced by a diverse range of sesquiterpene synthases. A comprehensive analysis of these enzymes in terms of product specificity has been hampered by the lack of a centralized resource of sufficient functionally annotated sequence data. To address this, we have gathered 262 plant sesquiterpene synthase sequences with experimentally characterized products. The annotated enzyme sequences allowed for an analysis of terpene synthase motifs, leading to the extension of one motif and recognition of a variant of another. In addition, putative terpene synthase sequences were obtained from various resources and compared with the annotated sesquiterpene synthases. This analysis indicated regions of terpene synthase sequence space which so far are unexplored experimentally. Finally, we present a case describing mutational studies on residues altering product specificity, for which we analyzed conservation in our database. This demonstrates an application of our database in choosing likely-functional residues for mutagenesis studies aimed at understanding or changing sesquiterpene synthase product specificity.}

  abstract={The vast number of protein structures currently available opens exciting opportunities for machine learning on proteins, aimed at predicting and understanding functional properties. In particular, in combination with homology modelling, it is now possible to not only use sequence features as input for machine learning, but also structure features. However, in order to do so, robust multiple structure alignments are imperative. Here we present Caretta, a multiple structure alignment suite meant for homologous but sequentially divergent protein families which consistently returns accurate alignments with a higher coverage than current state-of-the-art tools. Caretta is available as a GUI and command-line application and additionally outputs an aligned structure feature matrix for a given set of input structures, which can readily be used in downstream steps for supervised or unsupervised machine learning. We show Caretta’s performance on two benchmark datasets, and present an example application of Caretta in predicting the conformational state of cyclin-dependent kinases.}

  abstract={Sesquiterpene synthases (STSs) catalyze the formation of a large class of plant volatiles called sesquiterpenes. While thousands of putative STS sequences from diverse plant species are available, only a small number of them have been functionally characterized. Sequence identity-based screening for desired enzymes, often used in biotechnological applications, is difficult to apply here as STS sequence similarity is strongly affected by species. This calls for more sophisticated computational methods for functionality prediction. We investigate the specificity of precursor cation formation in these elusive enzymes. By inspecting multi-product STSs, we demonstrate that STSs have a strong selectivity towards one precursor cation. We use a machine learning approach combining sequence and structure information to accurately predict precursor cation specificity for STSs across all plant species. We combine this with a co-evolutionary analysis on the wealth of uncharacterized putative STS sequences, to pinpoint residues and distant functional contacts influencing cation formation and reaction pathway selection. These structural factors can be used to predict and engineer enzymes with specific functions, as we demonstrate by predicting and characterizing two novel STSs from Citrus bergamia.}

  abstract={As the number of experimentally solved protein structures rises, it becomes increasingly appealing to use structural information for predictive tasks involving proteins. Due to the large variation in protein sizes, folds and topologies, an attractive approach is to embed protein structures into fixed-length vectors, which can be used in machine learning algorithms aimed at predicting and understanding functional and physical properties. Many existing embedding approaches are alignment based, which is both time-consuming and ineffective for distantly related proteins. On the other hand, library- or model-based approaches depend on a small library of fragments or require the use of a trained model, both of which may not generalize well. We present Geometricus, a novel and universally applicable approach to embedding proteins in a fixed-dimensional space. The approach is fast, accurate, and interpretable. Geometricus uses a set of 3D moment invariants to discretize fragments of protein structures into shape-mers, which are then counted to describe the full structure as a vector of counts. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in various tasks, ranging from fast structure similarity search, unsupervised clustering and structure classification across proteins from different superfamilies as well as within the same family.}

  abstract={Plant terpene synthases (TPSs) can mediate formation of a large variety of terpenes, and their diversification contributes to the specific chemical profiles of different plant species and chemotypes. Plant genomes often encode a number of related terpene synthases, which can produce very different terpenes. The relationship between TPS sequence and resulting terpene product is not completely understood. In this work we describe two TPSs from the Camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. One of these, CiCaMS, acts as a monoterpene synthase (monoTPS), and mediates the production of myrcene, while the other, CiCaSSy, acts as a sesquiterpene synthase (sesquiTPS), and catalyses the production of α-santalene, β-santalene and trans-α-bergamotene. Interestingly, these enzymes share 97% DNA sequence identity and differ only in 22 amino acid residues out of 553. To understand which residues are essential for the catalysis of monoterpenes resp. sesquiterpenes, a number of hybrid synthases were prepared, and supplemented by a set of single-residue variants. These were tested for their ability to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes by in vivo production of sesquiterpenes in E. coli, and by in vitro enzyme assays. This analysis pinpointed three residues in the sequence which could mediate the change in product specificity from a monoterpene synthase to a sesquiterpene synthase. Another set of three residues defined the sesquiterpene product profile, including the ratios between sesquiterpene products.}

  abstract={The growing prevalence and popularity of protein structure data, both experimental and computationally modelled, necessitates fast tools and algorithms to enable exploratory and interpretable structure-based machine learning. Alignment-free approaches have been developed for divergent proteins, but proteins sharing func-tional and structural similarity are often better understood via structural alignment, which has typically been too computationally expensive for larger datasets. Here, we introduce the concept of rotation-invariant shape-mers to multiple structure alignment, creating a structure aligner that scales well with the number of proteins and allows for aligning over a thousand structures in 20 minutes. We demonstrate how alignment-free shape-mer counts and aligned structural features, when used in machine learning tasks, can adapt to different levels of functional hierarchy in protein kinases, pinpointing residues and structural fragments that play a role in catalytic activity.}

Recent developments in computational methods for protein structure predictions have reached the accuracy of experimentally determined models. Although this has been independently verified, the implementation of these methods across structural-biology applications remains to be tested. Here, we evaluate the use of AlphaFold2 (AF2) predictions in the study of characteristic structural elements; the impact of missense variants; function and ligand binding site predictions; modeling of interactions; and modeling of experimental structural data. For 11 proteomes, an average of 25\% additional residues can be confidently modeled when compared with homology modeling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the Protein Data Bank. AF2-based predictions of protein disorder and complexes surpass dedicated tools, and AF2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared with experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered. In summary, we find that these advances are likely to have a transformative impact in structural biology and broader life-science research.},

    Strigolactones (SLs) are rhizosphere signalling molecules and phytohormones. The biosynthetic pathway of SLs in tomato has been partially elucidated, but the structural diversity in tomato SLs predicts that additional biosynthetic steps are required. Here, root RNA-seq data and co-expression analysis were used for SL biosynthetic gene discovery.
    This strategy resulted in a candidate gene list containing several cytochrome P450s. Heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and yeast showed that one of these, CYP712G1, can catalyse the double oxidation of orobanchol, resulting in the formation of three didehydro-orobanchol (DDH) isomers.
    Virus-induced gene silencing and heterologous expression in yeast showed that one of these DDH isomers is converted to solanacol, one of the most abundant SLs in tomato root exudate. Protein modelling and substrate docking analysis suggest that hydroxy-orbanchol is the likely intermediate in the conversion from orobanchol to the DDH isomers.
    Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the occurrence of CYP712G1 homologues in the Eudicots only, which fits with the reports on DDH isomers in that clade. Protein modelling and orobanchol docking of the putative tobacco CYP712G1 homologue suggest that it can convert orobanchol to similar DDH isomers as tomato.

    We are now entering a new era in protein sequence and structure annotation, with hundreds of millions of predicted protein structures made available through the AlphaFold database1. These models cover nearly all proteins that are known, including those challenging to annotate for function or putative biological role using standard homology-based approaches. In this study, we examine the extent to which the AlphaFold database has structurally illuminated this “dark matter” of the natural protein universe at high predicted accuracy. We further describe the protein diversity that these models cover as an annotated interactive sequence similarity network, accessible at https://uniprot3d.org/atlas/AFDB90v4. By searching for novelties from sequence, structure, and semantic perspectives, we uncovered the β-flower fold, added multiple protein families to Pfam database2, and experimentally demonstrate that one of these belongs to a new superfamily of translation-targeting toxin-antitoxin systems, TumE-TumA. This work underscores the value of large-scale efforts in identifying, annotating, and prioritising novel protein families. By leveraging the recent deep learning revolution in protein bioinformatics, we can now shed light into uncharted areas of the protein universe at an unprecedented scale, paving the way to innovations in life sciences and biotechnology.

The Binding-Site Superposed, Symmetry-Corrected Pose Root Mean Square Deviation (BiSyRMSD) evaluated the absolute deviations of the models from the experimental structures. At the same time, the Local Distance Difference Test for Protein–Ligand Interactions (lDDT-PLI) assessed the ability of models to reproduce the protein–ligand interactions in the experimental structures. The ligands evaluated in this challenge range from single-atom ions to large flexible organic molecules. More than 1800 submissions were evaluated for their ability to predict 23 different protein–ligand complexes. Overall, the best models could faithfully reproduce the geometries of more than half of the prediction targets.

	abstract = {Today digital revolution is having a dramatic impact on the pharmaceutical industry and the entire healthcare system. The implementation of machine learning, extreme-scale computer simulations, and big data analytics in the drug design and development process offers an excellent opportunity to lower the risk of investment and reduce the time to the patient. Within the LIGATE project, we aim to integrate, extend, and co-design best-in-class European components to design Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) solutions exploiting today's high-end supercomputers and tomorrow's Exascale resources, fostering European competitiveness in the field. The proposed LIGATE solution is a fully integrated workflow that enables to deliver the result of a virtual screening campaign for drug discovery with the highest speed along with the highest accuracy. The full automation of the solution and the possibility to run it on multiple supercomputing centers at once permit to run an extreme scale in silico drug discovery campaign in few days to respond promptly for example to a worldwide pandemic crisis.},

	abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) is a major staple crop in Africa, where its yield and the livelihood of millions are compromised by the parasitic witchweed Striga. Germination of Striga is induced by strigolactones exuded from maize roots into the rhizosphere. In a maize germplasm collection, we identified two strigolactones, zealactol and zealactonoic acid, which stimulate less Striga germination than the major maize strigolactone, zealactone. We then showed that a single cytochrome P450, ZmCYP706C37, catalyzes a series of oxidative steps in the maize-strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. Reduction in activity of this enzyme and two others involved in the pathway, ZmMAX1b and ZmCLAMT1, can change strigolactone composition and reduce Striga germination and infection. These results offer prospects for breeding Striga-resistant maize.},

	abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction demarcate the start of a new era in structural bioinformatics. Combined with various advances in experimental structure determination and the uninterrupted pace at which new structures are published, this promises an age in which protein structure information is as prevalent and ubiquitous as sequence. Machine learning in protein bioinformatics has been dominated by sequence-based methods, but this is now changing to make use of the deluge of rich structural information as input. Machine learning methods making use of structures are scattered across literature and cover a number of different applications and scopes; while some try to address questions and tasks within a single protein family, others aim to capture characteristics across all available proteins. In this review, we look at the variety of structure-based machine learning approaches, how structures can be used as input, and typical applications of these approaches in protein biology. We also discuss current challenges and opportunities in this all-important and increasingly popular field.},

	abstract = {Language models are now routinely used for text classification and generative tasks. Recently, the same architectures were applied to protein sequences, unlocking powerful tools in the bioinformatics field. Protein language models (pLMs) generate high dimensional embeddings on a per-residue level and encode the “semantic meaning” of each individual amino acid in the context of the full protein sequence. Multiple works use these representations as a starting point for downstream learning tasks and, more recently, for identifying distant homologous relationships between proteins. In this work, we introduce a new method that generates embedding-based protein sequence alignments (EBA), and show how these capture structural similarities even in the twilight zone, outperforming both classical sequence-based scores and other approaches based on protein language models. The method shows excellent accuracy despite the absence of training and parameter optimization. We expect that the association of pLMs and alignment methods will soon rise in popularity, helping the detection of relationships between proteins in the twilight-zone.},
