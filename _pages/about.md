I'm a project leader working on [bringing biochemical context to protein deep learning models](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/research-groups/project-leaders-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-durairaj-j), in Torsten Schwede's <em>[Protein Bioinformatics in 3D](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/research-groups/research-groups-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-torsten-schwede)</em> research group at the Biozentrum, University of Basel.
I work at the interface of protein structural bioinformatics and machine learning, developing efficient algorithms and 
software to represent, explore and understand protein structures for applications such as enzyme engineering, drug discovery and biomedicine.
