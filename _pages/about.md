I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Torsten Schwede's <em>[Protein Bioinformatics in 3D](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/research-groups/research-groups-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-torsten-schwede)</em> research group at the Biozentrum, University of Basel.
I work at the interface of protein structural bioinformatics and machine learning, developing efficient algorithms and 
software to represent, explore and understand protein structures for applications ranging from enzyme engineering to drug discovery.
